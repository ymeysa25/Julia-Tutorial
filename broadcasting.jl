println("======= Broadcasting ===========")
# Broadcasting
# in julia, with boradcasting we indicates the action of mappinf a function
# or an operation (which are the same in Julia) over array or a matrix by element
# The broadcasting notation for operators consists of adding a dot . before the operator (for example .*)

#     Considering the example we get:
println(a.*c)
println(c .* a)
println(a .* d)
println(d .* a)

# another example
a = [1, 2, 3]
